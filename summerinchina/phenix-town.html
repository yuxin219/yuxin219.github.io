    <h1 style="font-size:50px; color:#df80ff">Second week:we traveled to Phoenix Acient Town in Hunan.</h1>
    <p id="river">The first place we traveled to was Fenghuang Ancient Town. It located at Wester boundary of Hunan. 'fenghuang' is Chinese for 'phoenix'. We arrived there at 2:00pm, we thought the stores will be open,no one on the street, and the whole town was sleeping. WE WERE WRONG! ✨✨✨The lights on the acient chinese biudings were reflcted on the river, most of the store were still opening. People were eating watermalone or BBQ near by the river. 2nd Day:it was a rainning day⛈️. Stair with running rain water looked like a men made waterfall.  </p>
